## About 

Since 2007, I use the Librarything website to track the books I purchase and read.
This application shows some statistics about my reading habits based on an export of this data.

I tend to buy more books than I can read, I wanted to know exactly what was the extend of the problem by displaying the evolution of books read versus books bought each month.
This was also the occasion to have a look at some other trends about my reading habits.

Librarything give the possibility to enter many information about books, here I make use of the following :

* date of purchase
* date of reading start
* date of reading end
* a rating between 0 and 5
* number of pages
* author

The source code of this application is available on Github: https://github.com/mmai/shiny-librarything
